## I. CORE STRUCTURE

**Phenomenon(x) = ℘(x) × f(x) × Φ(x)**

| Component | Explanation                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **℘(x)**  | Field of presence – the resonant space where phenomena can manifest                 |
| **f(x)**  | Activating oscillation – life rhythm, entropy, intrinsic system oscillation         |
| **Φ(x)**  | Formal structure – organizational logic, reflective structure, pattern of existence |

UPM states: there is no absolute reality – only **phenomena arising when all three components resonate in alignment (time–space–form).**

## II. GRAVITATIONAL MODEL UNDER UPM

### General Formula:

F₍UPM₎(r,t) = K · (m₁ · m₂) · \[1/r² + ∑ᵢ εᵢ · χᵢ(r, t)]

* K: gravitational resonance constant (adjustable according to ℘ layer)
* χᵢ(r, t): nonlinear resonant terms (e.g. sin, log, modulation)

### Model Examples:

* **Mercury’s orbit:** Uses sin(ωr) resonance form, reproduces 43"/century precession
* **Earth–Moon system:** Periodic oscillation Q(r,t) pattern
* **Galaxies & dark matter replacement:** Terms like 1/r + γ₂ replicate flat rotation curves

## III. CONCEPTUAL DISTINCTIONS

### 1. ℘(x) – Field of Presence

* Foundational resonant space – flexible, non-fixed
* Enables interaction between f(x) and Φ(x)

### 2. f(x) – Activating Oscillation

* Nonlinear, intrinsic oscillation, modulated by ℘(x)

### 3. Φ(x) – Formal Structure

* Represents the structural expression – logic, cognition, organization
* Not equivalent to "consciousness" – simply enables existence

## IV. MODEL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

* Construct Res(f₁, f₂) functions for resonance modeling
* Define Φ(x) independently from classical psychology
* Gather empirical data: GPS, atomic clocks, satellites, geobiological frequencies

## V. OPTIMAL RESONANCE PRINCIPLE (fₒₚₜ)

fₒₚₜ(x) = argmax\_f { Φ(x, f, ℘) achieving: stability + high reflection + fast response + sustained energy flow }

fₒₚₜ is not fixed – it acts as a compass for optimal resonance in any system: biology, AI, matter, emotion.

## VI. CONCLUSION

UPM is a model of phenomena – not an absolute theory. It provides a new referential framework to understand the world through resonance, open space, and energy-generating structure.

> "Everything that exists – is the result of properly layered resonance."

*This is a core compact version to serve as the foundation for extended models: from gravitational physics to biology, cognition, living systems, and artificial intelligence simulation.*
